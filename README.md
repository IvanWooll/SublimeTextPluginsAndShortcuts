To use any of these file copy them to the User folder of Sublime Text e.g. "/Users/ivanwooll/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User"

Files:

kotlin_data_class_format.py is a plugin that formats the raw 'toString()' output of a kotlin data class to make it more readable
okhttp_log_remove.py is a plugin that removes the lines that Okhttp adds to the JSON printed to the Android Logcat 

remove_logs_and_format.sublime-macro is a macro that selects all, calls log_remove, calls the 'pretty_json' plugin to format the resulting json and the unselects all.

There are also keybindings for shortcuts for all of the above
